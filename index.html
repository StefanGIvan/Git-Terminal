      Whether you are a novice, hoping to delve into the world of web design or
      an experienced webmaster keen to improve your skills, we’ve got online
      tutorials tailored to your web design needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our absolute beginner tutorial will turn you from wannabe to webmaster in
      just a few hours. Unlike many other HTML tutorials, it’s a step-by-step
      guide – not a boring long-winded reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our step-by-step guide teaches you the basics of HTML and how to build
      your first website. That means how to layout an HTML page, how to add text
      and images, how to add headings and text formatting, and how to use
      tables.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>HTML for Absolute Beginners</h3>
    <p>
      While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of
      mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead focus on giving you the
      practical skills to build your first site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page without
      spending the entire tutorial focusing too much on the “why.”
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic
      website and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further into the
      world of HTML using our follow-on guides.
    </p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to
      write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to
      create pages and make them functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall
      focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you
      how to build rather than design.
    </p>
    <h3>The History of HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others
      starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to
      jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether.
      The latest version is known as HTML5.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control
      how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags
      and attributes.
    </p>
    <h3>What are Tags and Attributes?</h3>
    <p>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.</p>
    <p>
      They work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing
      2 minutes in differentiating the two.
    </p>
    <h3>What Are HTML Tags?</h3>
    <p>
      Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually
      enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: &lt;h1&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most tags must be opened &lt;h1&gt; and closed &lt;/h1&gt; in order to
      function.
    </p>
    <h3>What are HTML Attributes?</h3>
    <p>
      Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the
      form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
    </p>
    <p>An example of an attribute is:</p>
    <li type="circle">
      &lt;img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog." /&gt;
    </li>
    <p>
      In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are
      attributes of the &lt;img /&gt; tag.
    </p>
    <h3>Golden Rules To Remember</h3>
    <ol start="1">
      <li>
        The vast majority of tags must be opened (&lt;tag&gt;) and closed
        (&lt;/tag&gt;) with the element information such as a title or text
        resting between the tags.
      </li>
      <li>
        When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which
        they were opened. For example:
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is really
            important!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="title">HTML Editors</p>
    <p>
      Now that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to learn
      how to build our first website.
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important, we
      need an HTML editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many choices on the market. Here are a handful of the most
      popular:
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">Sublime Text 3</p>
    <p>
      However, for this tutorial, we will use the Sublime Text 3 as it is free
      and also offers cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.
    </p>

    <br />
    <i>Sublime Text 3 has a mini-preview window on the right.</i>

        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Easily customizable</li>
          <li>Beginner-friendly</li>
          <li>Pleasant color schemes to choose from.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="flexColumn">
        <h2 class="consRed">Cons</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Can’t print documents or code</li>
          <li>No toolbar or dashboard available.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p class="subtitle">Notepad ++</p>
    <p>
      Another common choice for HTML and other language coders is Notepad ++. It
      is a tiny program to download and perform the functions you need for
      writing clean code.
    </p>
    <img src="notepad++.webp" alt="Notepad++" width="800" height="400" />
    <br />
    <i>This is Notepad ++. Far from glamorous but does the job.</i>

      <div class="flexColumn">

          <li>No support for Mac.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p class="subtitle">Komodo Edit</p>
    <p>
      Komodo Edit is one of two editors released by the same label. They offer a
      simple, open-source editor with a
      <b>variety of extensions and language support.</b>
    </p>
    <p>It is free to download.</p>
    <img src="KomodoEdit.png" alt="Komodo Edit" width="800px" height="400px" />

    <div class="flexRow">
      <div class="flexColumn">
        <p class="prosGreen">Pros</p>
        <ul class="disc">

        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p class="title">What To Avoid</p>
    <div class="flexRow">
      <div class="flexColumn">
        <p>
          <b>Do not use Microsoft Word</b> or any other word processor when
          writing HTML code, only an HTML editor or at the very least, your
          machine’s built-in notepad, is suitable for the task.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, ensure that you’ve installed a number of different browsers
          such as Chrome and Firefox in order to preview your upcoming creation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <p
          style="
            font-style: oblique;
            font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
            font-size: 21px;
            display: block;
            width: 30%;

        >
          "Your code’s front-end view varies from browser to browser – you will
          learn more about this with advanced CSS."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p class="title">Creating Your First HTML Webpage</p>
    <p>
      First off, you need to open your HTML editor, where you will find a clean
      white page on which to write your code.
    </p>
    <p>From there you need to layout your page with the following tags.</p>

    <p class="title">Basic Construction of an HTML Page</p>
    <p>
      These tags should be placed underneath each other
      <b>at the top of every HTML page</b> that you create.
    </p>

    <p>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — This tag specifies the language you will write on
      the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;html&gt; — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in
      HTML code.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;head&gt; — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff
      mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
    </p>
    <p>&lt;body&gt; — This is where the content of the page goes.</p>
