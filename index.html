        Whether you are a novice, hoping to delve into the world of web design
        or an experienced webmaster keen to improve your skills, we’ve got
        online tutorials tailored to your web design needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our absolute beginner tutorial will turn you from wannabe to webmaster
        in just a few hours. Unlike many other HTML tutorials, it’s a
        step-by-step guide – not a boring long-winded reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our step-by-step guide teaches you the basics of HTML and how to build
        your first website. That means how to layout an HTML page, how to add
        text and images, how to add headings and text formatting, and how to use
        tables.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>HTML for Absolute Beginners</h3>
      <p>
        While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of
        mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead focus on giving you the
        practical skills to build your first site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page without
        spending the entire tutorial focusing too much on the “why.”
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a
        basic website and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further
        into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.
      </p>
      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to
        write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to
        create pages and make them functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we
        shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on
        teaching you how to build rather than design.
      </p>
      <h3>The History of HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others
        starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader
        to jump to other places in the document or to another document
        altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control
        how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things:
        tags and attributes.
      </p>
      <h3>What are Tags and Attributes?</h3>
      <p>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.</p>
      <p>
        They work together but perform different functions – it is worth
        investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
      </p>
      <h3>What Are HTML Tags?</h3>
      <p>
        Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are
        usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: &lt;h1&gt;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most tags must be opened &lt;h1&gt; and closed &lt;/h1&gt; in order to
        function.
      </p>
      <h3>What are HTML Attributes?</h3>
      <p>
        Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the
        form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
      </p>
      <p>An example of an attribute is:</p>
      <li type="circle">
        &lt;img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog." /&gt;
      </li>
      <p>
        In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are
        attributes of the &lt;img /&gt; tag.
      </p>
      <h3>Golden Rules To Remember</h3>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>
          The vast majority of tags must be opened (&lt;tag&gt;) and closed
          (&lt;/tag&gt;) with the element information such as a title or text
          resting between the tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in
          which they were opened. For example:
          <ul type="circle">
            <li>
              &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is really
              important!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="title">HTML Editors</p>
      <p>
        Now that we’ve gotten the basic theory out of the way. It’s time to
        learn how to build our first website.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important,
        we need an HTML editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many choices on the market. Here are a handful of the most
        popular:
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">Sublime Text 3</p>
      <p>
        However, for this tutorial, we will use the Sublime Text 3 as it is free
        and also offers cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and Linux
        users.
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="subtitle">Notepad ++</p>
      <p>
        Another common choice for HTML and other language coders is Notepad ++.
        It is a tiny program to download and perform the functions you need for
        writing clean code.

        a simple, open-source editor with a

            machine’s built-in notepad, is suitable for the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, ensure that you’ve installed a number of different
            browsers such as Chrome and Firefox in order to preview your
            upcoming creation.
          </p>

        </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p class="title">Creating Your First HTML Webpage</p>
      <p>
        First off, you need to open your HTML editor, where you will find a
        clean white page on which to write your code.
      </p>
      <p>From there you need to layout your page with the following tags.</p>

      <p class="title">Basic Construction of an HTML Page</p>
      <p>
        These tags should be placed underneath each other
        <b>at the top of every HTML page</b> that you create.
      </p>

      <p>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — This tag specifies the language you will write
        on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;html&gt; — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write
        in HTML code.
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;head&gt; — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff
        mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
      </p>
      <p>&lt;body&gt; — This is where the content of the page goes.</p>
      <img
        src="html-homepage-layout-demo.webp"
        alt="HTMLlayout"
        width="800px"
        height="800px"
        class="imageDesign"
      />
      <p>This is how your average HTML page is structured visually.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">Further Tags</p>
      <p>
        Inside the &lt;head&gt; tag, there is one tag that is always included:
        &lt;title&gt;, but there are others that are just as important:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt class="redCode">&lt;title&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          This is where we <b>insert the page name</b> as it will appear at the
          top of the browser window or tab.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dt class="redCode">&lt;meta&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          This is where information about the document is stored: character
          encoding, name (page context), description.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        <strong>Let’s try out a basic &lt;head&gt; section:</strong>
      </p>
      <div style="padding-left: 50px">
        <p><span class="redCode">&lt;head&gt;</span></p>
        <p>
          <span class="redCode">&lt;title&gt;</span>My First Webpage<span
            class="redCode"
            >&lt;/title&gt;</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="redCode">&lt;meta</span> charset="UTF-8"<span
            class="redCode"
            >&gt;</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="redCode">&lt;meta</span> name="description" content="This
          field contains information about your page. It is usually around two
          sentences long."<span class="redCode">&gt;</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="redCode">&lt;meta</span> name="author" content="Conor
          Sheils"<span class="redCode">&gt;</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="redCode">&lt;/header&gt;</span></p>
      </div>
      <p class="title">Adding Content</p>
      <p>
        The HTML &lt;body&gt;is where we add the content which is designed for
        viewing by human eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes <b>text, images, tables, forms</b> and everything else
        that we see on the internet each day.
      </p>
      <p class="title">How to Add HTML Headings To Your Web Page</p>
      <p>In HTML, headings are written in the following elements:</p>
      <ul type="disc" class="redCode" style="background-color: unset">
        <li>
          &lt;h1&gt;
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              &lth2&gt;
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                  &lth3&gt;
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>
                      &lth4&gt;
                      <ul type="disc">
                        <li>
                          &lth5&gt;
                          <ul type="disc">
                            <li>&lth6&gt;</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As you might have guessed <span class="redCode">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and
        <span class="redCode">&lt;h2&gt;</span> should be used for the most
        important titles, while the remaining tags should be used for
        sub-headings and less important text.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Search engine bots use this order</b> when deciphering which
        information is most important on a page.
      </p>
      <p class="title">Creating Your Heading</p>
      <p>Let’s try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type:</p>
      <div style="padding-left: 50px">
        <p class="redCode">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Page&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        And hit save. We will save this file as “index.html” in a new folder
        called “my webpage.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote displayBlock" style="width: 60%">
          <strong>The Moment of Truth:</strong> Click the newly saved file and
          your first ever web page should open in your default browser. It may
          not be pretty it’s yours… all yours. *Evil laugh*
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Well let’s not get carried away; we’ve still got loads of great features
        that we can add to your page.
      </p>
      <p class="title">How To Add Text In HTML</p>
      <p>
        Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the
        tag &lt;p&gt; which creates a new paragraph. We place all of our regular
        text inside the element &lt;p&gt;.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we
        can use to <b>control the text or make it appear in a certain way.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">Other Key Elements</p>
      <p>They are as follows:</p>

      <div>
        <table class="tableBlue">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Element</th>
              <th>Meaning</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr class="tableCyan">
              <td><b>&lt;b&gt;</b></td>
              <td>Bold</td>
              <td>Hightlight important information</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="tableSmoke">
              <td><b>&lt;strong&gt;</b></td>
              <td>Strong</td>
              <td>Similarly to bold, to highlight key text</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="tableCyan">
              <td><b>&lt;i&gt;</b></td>
              <td>Italic</td>

        These tags <b>must</b> be opened and closed around the text in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type the following
        HTML code:
      </p>
      <p class="redCode">
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; brand new website. This site
        will be my &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;strong&gt; home on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t forget to <b>hit save and then refresh the page</b> in your
        browser to see the results.

      <p class="title">How To Add Links In HTML</p>
      <p>As you may have noticed, the internet is made up of lots of links.</p>
      <p>
        Almost everything you click on while surfing the web is a link
        <b>takes you to another page</b> within the website you are visiting or
        to an external site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Links are included in an attribute opened by the
        <span class="blueCode">&lt;a&gt;</span>
        tag. This element is the first that we’ve met which uses an attribute
        and so it
        <b>looks different to previously mentioned tags.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">The Anchor Tag</p>
      <p>The &lt;a&gt; (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:</p>
      <p class="redCode">
        &lt;<span class="blueCode"
          >a href="https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/</span
        >"&lt;Your Link Text Here &lt;/a&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>first part</b> of the attribute
        <b>points to the page that will open</b> once the link is clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the <b>second part</b> of the attribute contains the
        <b>text which will be displayed</b> to a visitor in order to entice them
        to click on that link.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all
        of your pages on professional web hosting. In this case, internal links
        on your website will &lt;a href="”mylinkedpage.html”"&gt;Linktle
        Here&lt;/a&gt;.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">Let's Create An Anchor Tag</p>
      <p>
        Let’s try it out. Make a duplicate of the code from your current
        index.html page. Copy / paste it into a new window in your HTML editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Save this new page as “page2.html” and ensure that it is saved in the
        same folder as your index.html page.
      </p>
      <p>On page2.html add the following code:</p>
      <p class="redCode">
        &lt;a href="<span class="blueCode">http://www.google.com</span
        >"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>first part</b> of the attribute
        <b>points to the page that will open</b> once the link is clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the <b>second part</b> of the attribute contains the
        <b>text which will be displayed</b> to a visitor in order to entice them
        to click on that link.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all
        of your pages on professional web hosting. In this case, internal links
        on your website will &lt;a href=”mylinkedpage.html”&gt;Linktle
        Here&lt;/a&gt;.
